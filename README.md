## go-schema-registry

Go-schema-registry is a library to interact with Confluent's [Schema Registry](http://docs.confluent.io/current/schema-registry/docs/index.html), and create Codecs to be used with [goavro](https://github.com/karrick/goavro). 

Note: This is a work in progress. It is not feature complete, and do not expect any APIs to remain the same.

### Installation
